-- This is a library for /selective applicative functors/, or just
-- /selective functors/ for short, an abstraction between applicative functors
-- and monads, introduced in this paper:
-- https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/andrey.mokhov/selective-functors.pdf.
--
-- This module defines /freer rigid selective functors/. Rigid selective
-- functors are those that satisfy the property @\<*\> = apS@. Compared to the
-- "free" construction from "Control.Selective.Rigid.Free", this "freer"
-- construction does not require the underlying base data type to be a functor.

-- Inspired by free applicative functors by Capriotti and Kaposi.
-- See: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.0749.pdf

-- Note: In the current implementation, 'fmap' and 'select' cost O(N), where N
-- is the number of effects. It is possible to improve this to O(1) by using the
-- idea developed for free applicative functors by Dave Menendez, see this blog
-- post: https://www.eyrie.org/~zednenem/2013/05/27/freeapp.
-- An example implementation can be found here:
-- http://hackage.haskell.org/package/free/docs/Control-Applicative-Free-Fast.html
