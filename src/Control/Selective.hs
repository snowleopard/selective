-- | Selective applicative functors. You can think of 'select' as a selective
-- function application: when given a value of type 'Left' @a@, you __must apply__
-- the given function, but when given a 'Right' @b@, you __may skip__ the
-- function and associated effects, and simply return the @b@.
--
-- Note that it is not a requirement for selective functors to skip unnecessary
-- effects. It may be counterintuitive, but this makes them more useful. Why?
-- Typically, when executing a selective computation, you would want to skip the
-- effects (saving work); but on the other hand, if your goal is to statically
-- analyse a given selective computation and extract the set of all possible
-- effects (without actually executing them), then you do not want to skip any
-- effects, because that defeats the purpose of static analysis.
--
-- The type signature of 'select' is reminiscent of both '<*>' and '>>=', and
-- indeed a selective functor is in some sense a composition of an applicative
-- functor and the 'Either' monad.
--
-- Laws:
--
-- * Identity:
--
-- @
-- x \<*? pure id = either id id \<$\> x
-- @
--
-- * Distributivity; note that @y@ and @z@ have the same type @f (a -> b)@:
--
-- @
-- pure x \<*? (y *\> z) = (pure x \<*? y) *\> (pure x \<*? z)
-- @
--
-- * Associativity:
--
-- @
-- x \<*? (y \<*? z) = (f \<$\> x) \<*? (g \<$\> y) \<*? (h \<$\> z)
--   where
--     f x = Right \<$\> x
--     g y = \a -\> bimap (,a) ($a) y
--     h z = uncurry z
-- @
--
-- * Monadic 'select' (for selective functors that are also monads):
--
-- @
-- select = selectM
-- @
--
-- There are also a few useful theorems:
--
-- * Apply a pure function to the result:
--
-- @
-- f \<$\> select x y = select (fmap f \<$\> x) (fmap f \<$\> y)
-- @
--
-- * Apply a pure function to the @Left@ case of the first argument:
--
-- @
-- select (first f \<$\> x) y = select x ((. f) \<$\> y)
-- @
--
-- * Apply a pure function to the second argument:
--
-- @
-- select x (f \<$\> y) = select (first (flip f) \<$\> x) ((&) \<$\> y)
-- @
--
-- * Generalised identity:
--
-- @
-- x \<*? pure y = either y id \<$\> x
-- @
--
-- * A selective functor is /rigid/ if it satisfies '<*>' @=@ 'apS'. The
-- following /interchange/ law holds for rigid selective functors:
--
-- @
-- x *\> (y \<*? z) = (x *\> y) \<*? z
-- @
--
-- If f is also a 'Monad', we require that 'select' = 'selectM', from which one
-- can prove '<*>' @=@ 'apS'.

{- Why do we have skew associativity, where we can reassociate effects to the
   left but not to the right?

   The following two tables, which list all possible combinations of effect
   execution and skipping, might give you some intuition on why this happens.

     ---------------
     (x <*? y) <*? z
     ---------------
      1     0      0
      1     1      0
      1     0      1
      1     1      1

     ---------------
     x <*? (y <*? z)
     ---------------
     1      0     0
     1      1     0
     1      1     1

   A key observation is that when effects are associated to the right, we can't
   skip the effect y and execute the effect z: combination 101 is impossible.

-- | The 'branch' function is a natural generalisation of 'select': instead of
-- skipping an unnecessary effect, it chooses which of the two given effectful
-- functions to apply to a given argument; the other effect is unnecessary. It
-- is possible to implement 'branch' in terms of 'select', which is a good
-- puzzle (give it a try!).

{- Here is why composing selective functors is tricky.

Consider @Compose Maybe IO@. The only sensible implementation is:

> select (Just x) (Just y) = Just (select x y)
> select (Just x) Nothing  = Nothing -- Can't use Just: we don't have @a -> b@!

In other words, we have to be 'Applicative' on the outside functor 'Maybe',
because there is no way to peek inside 'IO', which forces us to statically
choose between 'Just', which doesn't work since we have no function @a -> b@,
and 'Nothing' which corresponds to the behaviour of 'selectA'.

1) A generic 'failIfLeft' if not possible, although many actual instances should
   be able to implement it.

2) More importantly, this requires duplication of work: if we failed becauase we
   happened to parse a 'Left' value in the first parser, then we need to rerun
   it, obtain a 'Left' once again, and then execute the second parser. Again, a
   specific instance may be able to cache the result and reuse it without
   duplicating any work, but this does not seem to be possible to achieve
   generically for any Alternative.
