\section{Introduction}\label{sec-intro}

% , further referred to simply as \emph{effects}

\emph{Monads}, introduced to functional programming
by~\citet{1995_wadler_monads}, are a powerful and general approach for
describing effectful (or impure) computations using pure functions. The key
ingredient of the monad abstraction is the \emph{bind} operator, denoted by
\hs{>>=} in Haskell\footnote{We use Haskell throughout this paper, but the
presented results are not specific to Haskell and do not require any advanced
features of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (any Haskell98~\citep{haskell98}
compliant compiler will do). Furthermore, we release two libraries for selective
applicative functors along with this paper: for Haskell and OCaml.}:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
(>>=) :: Monad f => f a -> (a -> f b) -> f b
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
The operator takes two arguments: an effectful computation \hs{f}~\hs{a}, which
yields a value of type~\hs{a} when executed, and a recipe, i.e. a pure function
of type \hs{a}~\hs{->}~\hs{f}~\hs{b}, for turning~\hs{a} into a subsequent
computation of type \hs{f}~\hs{b}. This approach to composing effectful
computations is inherently sequential: until we execute the effects in
\hs{f}~\hs{a}, there is no way of obtaining the computation \hs{f}~\hs{b},
i.e. these computations can only be performed in sequence.

Consider a simple example, where we use the monad \hs{f}~\hs{=}~\hs{IO} to
describe an effectful program that prints \hs{"pong"} if the user enters
\hs{"ping"}:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
pingPongM :: IO ()
pingPongM = getLine >>= \s -> if s@\,@==@\,@"ping" then putStrLn "pong" else pure ()
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}

\noindent
The first argument of the bind operator reads a string using
\hs{getLine}~\hs{::}~\hs{IO}~\hs{String}, and the second argument is the
function of type \hs{String}~\hs{->}~\hs{IO}~\hs{()}, which prints \hs{"pong"}
when~\hs{s}~\hs{==}~\hs{"ping"}.

This way of composing effects is sometimes unsatisfactory. To \emph{inspect} the
function \hs{\s}~\hs{->}~\hs{...}, we need an~\hs{s}, which becomes available
only during execution; we are therefore unable to predict the effects that
\hs{pingPongM} might perform: instead of conditionally executing \hs{putStrLn},
as intended, it might delete a file from disk, or launch proverbial missiles. As
we will see in sections~\S\ref{sec-static} and~\S\ref{sec-haxl}, in some
applications it is desirable to know all possible effects \emph{statically},
i.e. before the execution.

\emph{Applicative functors}, introduced by~\citet{mcbride2008applicative}, can
be used for composing statically known collections of effectful computations, as
long as these computations are \emph{independent} from each other. The key
ingredient of applicative functors is the \emph{apply} operator, denoted
by~\hs{<*>}:

\vspace{1mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
(<*>) :: Applicative f => f (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
\end{minted}
\vspace{1mm}
\newpage

\noindent
The operator takes two effectful computations, which --- independently ---
compute values of types \hs{a}~\hs{->}~\hs{b} and \hs{a}, and returns their
composition that performs both computations, and applies the obtained function
to the obtained value producing the result of type \hs{b}. Crucially, both
arguments and associated effects are known statically, which, for example,
allows us to pre-allocate all necessary computation resources upfront
(\S\ref{sec-static}) and execute all computations in parallel
(\S\ref{sec-haxl}).

Alas, our ping-pong example cannot be expressed using applicative functors.
Since the two computations must be independent, the best we can do is to print
\hs{"pong"} unconditionally:

\vspace{0.5mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
pingPongA :: IO ()
pingPongA = fmap (\s -> id) getLine <*> putStrLn "pong"
\end{minted}
\vspace{0.5mm}

\noindent
We use \hs{fmap}~\hs{(\s}~\hs{->}~\hs{id)} to replace the input string \hs{s},
which we now have no need for, with the identity function
\hs{id}~\hs{::}~\hs{()}~\hs{->}~\hs{()}, thus matching the return type of
\hs{putStrLn}~\hs{"pong"}~\hs{::}~\hs{IO}~\hs{()}. We cannot execute the
\hs{putStrLn} effect conditionally but, on the positive side, the effects are no
longer hidden behind opaque effect-generating functions, which makes it possible
for the applicative functor \hs{f}~\hs{=}~\hs{IO} to statically know the two
effects embedded in \hs{pingPongA}.

At this point the reader is hopefully wondering: can we combine the advantages
of applicative functors and monads, i.e. allow for conditional execution of some
effects while retaining the ability to statically know all effects embedded in
a computation? It will hardly be a surprise that the answer is positive, but it
is far from obvious what the right abstraction should be. For example, one might
consider adding a new primitive called \hs{whenS} to \hs{IO}:

\vspace{0.5mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
whenS :: IO Bool -> IO () -> IO ()
\end{minted}
\vspace{0.5mm}

\noindent
This primitive executes the first computation, and then uses the obtained
\hs{Bool} to decide whether to execute the second computation or not. Let us
rewrite the ping-pong example using \hs{whenS}:

\vspace{0.5mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
pingPongS :: IO ()
pingPongS = whenS (fmap ("ping"==) getLine) (putStrLn "pong")
\end{minted}
\vspace{0.5mm}

\noindent
We replace the input string~\hs{s} with \hs{True} if it is equal to \hs{"ping"},
and \hs{False} otherwise, thereby appropriately \emph{selecting} the subsequent
effectful computation. This approach gives us both conditional execution of
\hs{putStrLn}~\hs{"pong"}, and static visibility of both effects. Crucially,
\hs{whenS} must be an \hs{IO} primitive instead of being implemented in terms of
the monadic bind (\hs{>>=}), because the latter would result in wrapping
\hs{putStrLn} into an opaque function, as in \hs{pingPongM}.

The main idea of this paper is that \hs{whenS}, as well as many other similar
combinators, can be seen as special cases of a new intermediate abstraction,
called \emph{selective applicative functors}, whose main operator for composing
effectful computations is \emph{select}:

\vspace{0.5mm}
\begin{minted}[xleftmargin=10pt]{haskell}
select :: Selective f => f (Either a b) -> f (a -> b) -> f b
\end{minted}
\vspace{0.5mm}

\noindent
Intuitively, the first effectful computation is used to select what happens
next: if it yields a \hs{Left}~\hs{a} you \emph{must execute} the second
computation in order to produce a \hs{b} in the end; otherwise, if it yields a
\hs{Right}~\hs{b}, you \emph{may skip} the subsequent effect, because you have
no use for the resulting function.

The contributions of this paper are as follows:

\vspace{-1mm}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We introduce \emph{selective applicative functors} as a general
    abstraction situated between applicative functors and monads, characterising
    the relationships between all three abstractions with a set of laws, and
    defining a few important instances (\S\ref{sec-selective}).
    \item We discuss applications of the abstraction on two real-life case
    studies: the OCaml build system \Dune~\citep{dune} (\S\ref{sec-static}) and
    Facebook's \Haxl library~\cite{marlow2014haxl} (\S\ref{sec-haxl}).
    \item We present \emph{free selective applicative functors} and show how to
    use them to implement embedded domain-specific languages with both
    conditional effects and static analysis (\S\ref{sec-free}).
\end{itemize}

We discuss alternatives to selective applicative functors and related work in
sections~\S\ref{sec-alternatives} and \S\ref{sec-related}.
